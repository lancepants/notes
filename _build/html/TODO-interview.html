<h2>Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Files, inodes, filesystems...how do they work? What are file descriptors?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Filesystems, inodes, file descriptors</strong>: Described in <span class="xref std std-ref">filesystems</span></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What are semaphores? What is a mutex? What&#8217;s the difference between the two?</li>
</ul>
<p>A semaphore is best described as a signaling mechanism, but could also be described as a type of lock. A semaphore is an object that contains a (natural) number, on which two modifying operations are defined. One operation, V, adds 1 to the number. The other operation, P, removes 1. Because the natural number 0 cannot be decreased, calling P on a semaphore containing 0 will block the execution of the calling process/thread until some other thread comes along and calls a V on that semaphore. You may create a semaphore with more than one &#8220;slot&#8221; available (ie: s(6)). As such, semaphores can be used to restrict acess to a certain resource to a maximum (but variable) number of processes.</p>
<p>A mutex is a locking mechanism which helps multiple tasks serialize their access to a shared resource. It&#8217;s simply some function or object you call prior to performing a block of code on some shared resource. Your first call sets a locked flag, then you run your code, and then your second call to the mutex releases the lock.</p>
<p>You might think of a semaphore or a mutex as a key to a bathroom. One key, one door works well for a mutex or a semaphore(1). But above we mentioned semaphores can count higher than one...so one key for six bathrooms. A mutex will not scale in this scenario as it would block each time 1/6 resources are used. A semaphore will allow 6 people to use the bathrooms at once, but it has no idea which bathroom is free at which time. What you end up needing is a separate mutex for each resource regardless.</p>
<p>Because of this, you should not be relying solely on semaphores for locking - in fact, you really should only be using semaphores for simple signaling. For example, have a semaphore for power button which your display subscribes to (semaPend(sem_pwr_button); //wait for signal), such that when the power button is hit, a post (V, increment, semaPost(sem_pwr_button); //send the signal)) is sent and your display thread then unblocks and performs some_code. Another use could be naive throttling: only allow 3 threads to access a database at once.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How are cookies passed in the HTTP protocol?</li>
</ul>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The server sends one of these in its response header (square brackets optional):</dt>
<dd>Set-Cookie: &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;[; expires=&lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt;][; domain=&lt;em&gt;domain&lt;/em&gt;][; path=&lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt;][; secure]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that &#8220;value&#8221; above is a string, and is almost always in a format like this: <strong>key=value</strong> , and is usually enforced as such.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>And if the client accepts the cookie write, it sends this in its next request header:</dt>
<dd>Cookie: name=value</dd>

<ul class="simple">
<li>How does traceroute work?</li>
</ul>
<p>ICMP packets are sent, with the initial packet having a TTL of 0 and each consecutive packet having its TTL incremented by one. This elicits a response along each hop of a network path. The TTL count exists in the IP header.</p>

<h3>Google Glassdoor<a class="headerlink" href="#google-glassdoor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rank the following in terms of speed: access a register, access main memory, perform a context switch, hd seek time</li>
</ul>
<p>1 Register. 1 or 2 cycles. Smallest and fastest memory on a system. A compiler will typically allocate registers to hold values retrieved from main memory.
2 Perform a context switch (which type? assuming thread switch). 30-60 cycles best case.
3 Access main memory. NUMA local: 100 cycles NUMA remote: 300 cycles for no/normal congestion
4 HD seek time. A typical hdd needs anywhere from 2.5ms to 6.5ms to seek, depending on rotational speed (2ms=15k). Arm movement (stroke/track-to-track) takes anywhere from 0.2 to 1ms. SSD seek time is around 0.08-0.16ms</p>
<p><strong>Context Switch:</strong> The process of storing execution state of a process or thread so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Context Switch&#8221; can mean several different things, including: thread switch (switching
between two threads within a given process), process switch (switching between two
processes), mode switch (domain crossing: switching between user mode and kernel mode
within a given thread), and more.</div></blockquote>
<p>Which type of context switch you&#8217;re talking about can mean a very different performance costs. For example, a context switch pausing one thread and the cpu scheduling another where each thread is not sharing memory (separate working sets) could dirty the cpu cache if there is not enough space to hold both thread&#8217;s memory or the new thread fills the cache with new data. The same is true for processes. Additionally, if two processes share the same working set of memory and one is context switched out and another is scheduled in on a different core, it does not have access to the same cache/working set without a NUMA hop or a trip to main memory.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>What information is contained in a file inode?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Filesystems, inodes, file descriptors</strong>: Described in <span class="xref std std-ref">filesystems</span></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How is MTU size determined?</li>
</ul>
<p>MTU is referenced by packet (and frame) based protocols like TCP and UDP in order to determine the maximum size of packet it should construct for communication over a given interface. Something called <strong>Path MTU Discovery</strong> (PMTUD) is used in order to discover this value.</p>
<p>In IPv4, this works by setting the <em>DF</em> (don&#8217;t fragment) bit in the ip header of outgoing packets. Any device along the network path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop it and send back an ICMP <em>fragmentation needed</em> message containing its MTU. The source host reconfigures appropriately, and the process is repeated.</p>
<p>IPv6 works differently as it does not support fragmentation (nor the don&#8217;t fragment option). Instead, the initial packet MTU is set to the same as the source interface, and if it hits a device along the path where the packet size is too large for its MTU setting, that device drops the packet and sends back an ICMPv6 <em>Packet Too Big</em> message which contains its MTU. The source then reconfigures its MTU appropriately, and the process is repeated.</p>
<p>If the path MTU changes lower along the path after the connection is set up, the process still does its thing. If the MTU changes to a higher value, PMTUD will eventually discover this (Linux performs another PMTD check every 10 minutes by default) and increase MTU accordingly.</p>
<p>Some firewall operators will blanket deny all ICMP traffic. This means that after a TCP handshake happens and the first packet is sent out with a larger MTU than something along the link can handle, the firewall blocks the ICMP reply and you end up with a &#8220;black hole&#8221; connection where the source keeps retrying to send data and some device along the path keeps dropping it, with a blocked response. Some PMTUD attempt to infer this problem and lower MTU size accordingly, but the lack of response could also just be due to congestion.</p>
<p>Some routers may work around this issue by changing the <em>maximum segment size</em> (MSS) of all TCP connections passing through links which have an MTU lower than the ethernet default of 1500. While an MTU is concerned with the total size of a packet, MSS only determines the TCP Segment (minus TCP header) size - typical default = 536 Bytes.</p>

<li>Which system call returns inode information? (study all common system calls and know them)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kernel - System Calls</strong>: <span class="xref std std-ref">kernel-systemcalls</span></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What signal does the &#8220;kill&#8221; command send by default</li>
</ul>
<p>Kill sends a SIGTERM by default. Note that processes can ignore, block, or catch all signals except SIGSTOP and SIGKILL. If a process catches a signal, it means that <em>it includes code that will take appropriate action when the signal is received</em>. If the signal is not caught, the kernel will take the appropriate action for the signal.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SIGHUP is useful, most applications use this as an indication to reload their configuration without terminating themselves.</li>
<li>SIGINT is sent when you ctrl-c something. It is intended to provide a mechanism for an orderly, graceful shutdown of the foreground process. Interactive shells (mysql, other) may take it to mean &#8220;terminate current query&#8221; rather than the whole process.</li>
<li>SIGQUIT signals a process to terminate and do a core dump</li>

<li>Describe a TCP connection setup</li>

<li>What is the maximum length of a binary tree? (&#8220;n, because it could be unbalanced&#8221;)</li>
<li>What is the theoretical best trans-continental round-trip ping time?</li>
</ul>
<p>Light travels at just below 300,000KM/sec. Light travels through fiber around 30% slower, so 210,000KM/sec. London to NYC is about 5500KM. So, 5500/210000 = 0.026, or 26ms. Routers/switches only add microseconds of delay, so being generous, add 1ms total for both sides. So RTT = around 53ms. Verizon consistently sees 72ms between london and nyc in the real world.</p>

<li>What is a filesystem, how does it work?</li>
<li>What is a socket file? What is a named pipe?</li>
<li>(RobertL: Data written to a pipe is buffered by the kernel until it is read from the pipe. That buffer has a fixed size. Portable applications should not assume any particular size and instead be designed so as to read from the pipe as soon as data becomes available. The size on many Unix systems is a page, or as little as 4K. On recent versions of Linux, the size is 64K. What happens when the limit is reached depends on the O_NONBLOCK flag. By default (no flag), a write to a full pipe will block until sufficient space becomes available to satisfy the write. In non-blocking mode (flag provided), a write to a full pipe will fail and return EAGAIN.)</li>

<li>Suppose there is a server with high CPU load but there is no process with high CPU time. What could be the reason for that? How do you debug this problem?
-Typically this is due to very short lived processes. (look up how to detect this). Also, does a process in high IOWait have an associated high cpu usage?</li>
<li>What happens when a float is cast to/from a boolean in python?</li>
