  <p>~~Unix/Linux Internals~~</p>
<p>::System Calls::
The kernel is the only program running in a special CPU mode called kernel mode, allowing full access to devices and the execution of privileged instructions.</p>
<p>User processes run in user mode. These processes have a separate stack and registers (memory space) from kernel mode processes. These processes must request privileged operations from the kernel via system calls.</p>
<p>System calls are the primary mechanism by which user-space programs interact with the Linux kernel. The execution of privileged instructions in user mode causes exceptions, which are then handled by the kernel.</p>
<p>Popular system calls are open, read, write, close, wait, execve, fork, exit, and kill</p>
<p>System call process. Example using READ. Read wants to access a storage device to read some info and then transfer that info to its memory space:
-main process passes its arguments to libc_read
-libc_read loads the specific system call number (in this case __NR_read) into the cpu&#8217;s EAX register, as well as loads whatever other arguments (ie:what to read, the file descriptor of the file to read, etc) into other processor registers.
-libc_read then throws a special software interrupt which triggers an exception, which the kernel picks up and handles
-kernel code function system_call() is called, which has a look at the eax register to find out what system call to load
-sys_read() is called, which then uses the file descriptor it was passed to check for locks, and looks up a file struct which has a pointer to the function to call in order to handle that file type.
-sys_read() then does a read request to the device node driver function, which passes back information, and the process back up to userland is reversed</p>
<p>::VFS::
VFS works as an abstraction layer sitting between filesystems and system calls. By having this layer, a system call doesn&#8217;t need to know how to communicate with all these different filesystems (ext3, ufs, zfs, nfs, /proc, /dev), and instead only communicates to VFS. VFS then communicates to the file system.</p>
<p>::I/O Stack::
Application -&gt; System Calls -&gt; VFS -&gt; File System -&gt; Volume Manager -&gt; Block Device Interface -&gt; Target I/O Driver -&gt; Host Bus Adapter Driver -&gt; Disk Devices
It&#8217;s also possible for the system call to skip straight to block device interface.</p>
<p>::Linux Signals::
SIGHUP(1) - hangup - users terminal is disconnected somehow. Some daemons are programmed to reload their config and log files rather than close when they get this signal. If a process does not catch this signal, the default action of the parent is to close the process.
SIGINT(2) - interrupt - ctrl+c sends a sigint. SIGINT is nearly identical to SIGTERM. Ask the process to quit.
SIGKILL(9) - kill - forceful termination. Memory stripped. Cannot be ignored
SIGTERM(15) - Terminate. This asks the process to quit, go through its normal cleanup procedure
SIGSTOP(17,19,23) - Stop the process (to resume later). Cannot be ignored.
SIGSTP - Ask the process to stop temporarily.</p>
<p>SIGHUP by default exits a shell. An interactive shell will send a SIGHUP to all child jobs upon exit.</p>
<p>::Character vs Block Devices::
Character (aka raw) devices provide unbuffered, sequential access of any I/O size down to a single character, depending on the device. An example of this would be a keyboard  or a serial port.
Block devices perform I/O in units of blocks, which are typically 512bytes. Blocks can be accessed randomly based on their block offset (location), which begins at 0 at the start of the block device.</p>
<p>::/proc and /sys::
procfs exposes runtime information &amp; statistics of devices and processes, as well as allows you to change runtime variables on those devices and processes. Sysfs does the same thing, but provides a structure for this information. This structure is created by the kernel. Sysfs is intended as a replacement for procfs. All new stuff is expected to use sysfs rather than the unstructured dumping grounds of proc.
The sysfs (or /sys filesystem) was designed to add structure to the proc mess and provide a uniform way to expose system information and control points (settable system and driver attributes) to user-space from the kernel. Now, the driver framework in the kernel automatically creates directories under /sys when drivers are registered, based on the driver type and the values in their data structures.</p>
<p>#Check number of caches available to cpu0 and the size of those caches
grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index*/size (grep . is same as cat /path/to/files*)
(typical results, two 32k level 1 cache, 256k lvl2 cache, and 3MB lvl3 cache)</p>
<p>::Process Management::
Processes vs Threads:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Separate processes can not see each others memory. They have to communicate with each other via system calls (IPC). Threads share the same memory, so you lose the overhead. Unfortunately this also makes it easy for threads to step all over each other, with one thread perhaps changing a variable value without telling another thread. These are called Concurrency Problems.
It&#8217;s fully possible for a process to create a bunch of threads to do stuff, and the kernel won&#8217;t know about it. Its schedulers will keep treating the process as having one thread. This is bad for performance reasons. As such, there is a clone() system call (also used for process cloning) which allows registration and resource consideration within the kernel for a thread.</div></blockquote>
<p>Process creation, there are several ways. You can execute a program, and the kernel allocates memory for it and starts it up. You can also start a program from within a program by calling either exec() or fork(). exec() will replace the current running process, while fork() will create a child process and then exec() is called to run something in that new process.</p>
<p>Each process has a task_struct. This is a large structure which holds process data such as the state of execution, a stack, a set of flags, the parent process, the thread of execution (of which there can be many), and open files. The state variable is a set of bits that indicate the state of the task. The most common states indicate that the process is running or in a run queue about to be running (TASK_RUNNING), sleeping (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE), sleeping but unable to be woken up (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE), stopped (TASK_STOPPED), or a few others. The flags word defines a large number of indicators, indicating everything from whether the process is being created (PF_STARTING) or exiting (PF_EXITING), or even if the process is currently allocating memory (PF_MEMALLOC). The name of the executable (excluding the path) occupies the comm (command) field. The mm field represents the process&#8217;s memory descriptors.</p>
<p>So, each userspace process gets its own task_struct, except init which has a statically defined struct called init_task. These are collected into either a hash table (hashed by PID) or a circular doubly linked list. The circular list is ideal for iterating through, such as a process scheduler would do. There is no head or tail to this list, so you can use the init_task struct as a reference point to iterate further.</p>
<p>PROCESS CREATION (maybe read comp_sci and system call section first)
Both user space and kernel space tasks eventually rely on the do_fork function to create new processes.
In User Space:
-Program calls fork()
-fork() system calls to sys_fork()
-sys_fork() calls do_fork()
-do_fork() does an alloc_pidmap to get a new PID
-do_fork() then calls copy_process and passes the flags, stack, and registers used by the parent process, the parent process PID, and the newly allocated PID
-copy_process consults with Linux Security Module (LSM) to see whether the current task is allowed to create a new task
-copy_process then calls dup_task_struct, which creates a new kernel stack, thread_info structure, and task_struct for the new process. The new values are identical to those of the current task. At this point, the child and parent process descriptors are identical.
-Now the child needs to differentiate itself from its parent. Various members of the process descriptor are cleared or set to initial values. Members of the process descriptor that are not inherited are primarily statistic information. The bulk of the data in the process descriptor is shared.
-Next, the child&#8217;s state is set to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, to ensure that it does not yet run.
-Now, copy_process() calls copy_flags() to update the flags member of the task_struct. The PF_FORKNOEXEC flag, which denotes a process that has not called exec(), is set.
-Depending on the flags passed to clone(), copy_process() then either duplicates or shares open files, filesystem information, signal handlers, process address space, and namespace.
-The new task is then assigned to a processor, and control is passed back to do_fork() with a pointer to the new child
-The process isn&#8217;t actually running at this point, so do_fork() calls the function wake_up_new_task on it. This places the new process in a run queue and wakes it up for execution
-do_fork() then returns the new PID value to the caller</p>
<p>Process Scheduling:
The scheduler maintains lists of task_struct&#8217;s. Each list has a different priority number. task_struct&#8217;s are placed in each list based on loading and prior process execution history, along with other factors.</p>
<p>Process destruction:
-User space calls exit(), which makes a sys_exit() system call, which calls do_exit()
-do_exit() sets the PF_EXITING flag in the processes task_struct, which tells the kernel to avoid manipulating this process while it&#8217;s being removed
-do_exit() makes a series of calls. exit_mm to remove memory pages, exit_notify to notify the parent process and other things, and more?
-Finally, the process state is changed to PF_DEAD in its task_struct and the schedule function is called to select a new process to execute
-release_task is called which will reclaim memory that the process was using</p>
