teamd --help
teamd -t team0 -d  # Run teamd. Create new device team0 and daemonize
ip link set team0 up  # ifup the interface
ip a add 10.10.10.115/24 dev team0  # ip the interface
teamdctl --help  # check out the general team driver utility
teamdctl team0 state  # not much to see yet
teamdctl team0 port add p2p1  # this will fail if p2p1 has been set to UP already. ip link set p2p1 down if error
teamdctl team0 port add p2p2
teamdctl team0 state  # This should now show you more infos
ping 10.10.10.1  # Might take a couple seconds before successful

teamd -t team0 -k  # Terminate teamd and remove team0 device


# Alternately, the ip utility can set you up; however, use of teamd binary as above is reccommended
ip link add name team0 type team
ip link set eth0 master team0
# To remove:
ip link set eth0 nomaster
ip link del team0


# Using a config file with teamd
teamd -f team0.json -d

# Example config (man teamd.conf):
{
        "device": "team0",
        "runner": {
                "name": "lacp",
                "active": true,
                "fast_rate": true,
                "tx_hash": ["p2p", "ipv4", "ipv6"]
        },
        "link_watch": {"name": "ethtool"},
        "ports": {"p2p1": {}, "p2p2": {}}
}

# Something like "runner": {"name": "roundrobin"}, may be easier for initial link testing


# LACP on your switch (ARISTA!)
conf t
int et5-6
channel-group 100 mode active  # Active on the switch. Switch sends the LACP Protocol Data Units to form link with partner
int po100 ; no shut  # You might need to do this
# Check your shit
exit ; exit
sh int po100
sh int status connected # You should see po100 with status "connected"
sh port-channel summary # You should see Protocol: LACP(a)

# Back on your teamd box
teamdctl team0 state  # Should show runner: lacp and link up on all interfaces.
ip a add 10.10.10.115/24 dev team0
ping 10.10.10.1

# Back on switch, sh port-channel summary should show an accurate number of channels in use.
