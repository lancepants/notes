-A "foreign stream" is input from something else, such as kafka
-MySQL uses the words SCHEMA and DATABASE interchangably. It appears that SQLStream prefers the word SCHEMA. 
-Since SCHEMA is synonymous with DATABASE, first you have to define a schema name, and then SET SCHEMA myschema;  . This works like SET DATABASE mydatabase; - ie: there's no {braces} or other wrappers. When you create a stream after doing a set schema, the stream is created under that schema (aka database)
-The format of this input stream is defined when you create the stream. This sets out what fields you've got on your incoming foreign stream


EG1: Stream capturing order data from e-commerce pipeline
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA "WebData";
SET SCHEMA '"WebData"';
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "OrderData" (
   "key_order"    BIGINT NOT NULL,
   "key_user"     BIGINT,
   "country"      SMALLINT,
   "key_product"  INTEGER,
   "quantity"     SMALLINT,
   "eur"          DECIMAL(19,5),
   "usd"          DECIMAL(19,5)
) DESCRIPTION 'conditioned order data, ready for analysis';
