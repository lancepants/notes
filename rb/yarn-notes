OVERVIEW
YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is Hadoop’s next-generation cluster scheduler. It allows you to allocate a number of containers (processes) in a cluster of machines, and execute arbitrary commands on them.

When an application interacts with YARN, it looks something like this:

1. Application: I want to run command X on two machines with 512MB memory.
2. YARN: Cool, where’s your code?
3. Application: http://path.to.host/jobs/download/my.tgz
4. YARN: I’m running your job on node-1.grid and node-2.grid.

Yarn has three important pieces: a ResourceManager, a NodeManager, and an ApplicationMaster.
In a YARN grid, every machine runs a NodeManager, which is responsible for launching processes on that machine.
Applications talk to ResourceManager when they wish to run something on the cluster, and the ResourceManager talks to every NodeManager in order to tell them what to run
The ApplicationManager "application specific code which runs on the YARN cluster" which is responsible for asking for containers, handling notifications when a container fails, and "managing the application's workload" whatever that means.
