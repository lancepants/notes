HARDWARE
~~Blade 1~~
-all good

~~Blade 2~~
-blade 2 is getting a battery missing or not charged, and you have vd's configured for write-back mode. vd's affected:01. Write-through mode is active when battery failed, so these disks are gonna be real slow.
-all disks reporting good

~~Blade 3~~
-has one failed disk, 1:0

~~Blade 4~~
-all good

~~Blade 5~~
-Will not install
-has two dead disks, 1:2 and 1:6  (they go 0-6)
--1:2 is "not responding"
--1:6 is "FOREIGN, BAD"

~~Blade 6~~
-has a bad disk or three, and is crashing hard upon install with some sort of IRQ error. might be the controller. Getting a timeout checking "scsi-1", and just after some initial mount stuffs. it sometimes gets to package installation. it even installed after several reboots. getting buffer i/o error on device sdb..dunno wtf cause it was trying to write to /boot on /dev/sda. Running memtest but this looks like the controller or some super screwed disks on it

~~Blade 7~~
-all good

~~Blade 8~~
-all good

~~Blade 9~~
-Gets through install fine, then reports no OS found. Reconf'd raid...seeing system config error pre-bios message. Might just wanna recycle this

~~Blade 10~~
-good other than one disk
-1:5 is reporting FOREGIN and did have UNCONF-BAD. Doesn't seem to be affecting anything though. Disk might have formerly been configured in a different raid controller. Rebuild reports "Failed to start operation on physical drive"

Todo
-Replace blades 2,6,9
-Get 4 replacement disks
--blade3 1:0
--blade5 1:2
--blade5 1:6
--blade10 1:5




-Seagate ST9300603SS
-Default vg conf is dg0-4 with one disk in each of those. Then two spares or something?

TODO:
-Define partitioning in kickstart. Don't let autopart do it. (ref srd1001 anaconda-ks.cfg)
-Re-partition 1002-1010 after ks with partition shit is correct
