zkEnv.sh sets your java bin path. It looks for $JAVA_HOME. You have to "export JAVA_HOME". zkEnv.sh will add a /bin/java to whatever you've exported. Look in zookeeper.out for error...the start script reports STARTED even when it fails.

CLI examples:
bin/zkCli.sh -server 127.0.0.1:2181
help
ls /
create /omg oh-my-god-data-string
create /omg/wtf wut-the-fuck
set /omg/wtf wut-the-eff
get /omg
